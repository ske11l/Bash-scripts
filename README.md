# Bash scripts ✔️
## _These are my first bash scripts written with a Linux terminal_

### needs to be written based on the case command and you can use it to do some mathematical calculations.
```shell
./case.sh
```

### You can use it to output colored text (in blue only for now) 😄
```shell
./color.sh
```

### Is a script with if command, it will work if arguments are equal, and if you set different arguments then it will not work correctly
```shell
./if.sh
```

Serves to add the specified arguments
```shell
./sum_of_numbers.sh
```

is just a script with while loop, it will run as long as number 23 is less than 18 and with each executed command number 23 will decrease by 2.
```shell
./while.sh
```
