# Bash scripts ✔️
## _These are my first bash scripts written with a Linux terminal_

 case.sh - needs to be written based on the case command and you can use it to do some mathematical calculations.

 color.sh - You can use it to output colored text (in blue only for now) 😄

 if.sh - is a script with if command, it will work if arguments are equal, and if you set different arguments then it will not work correctly

sum of numbers.sh -  serves to add the specified arguments

while.sh - is just a script with while loop, it will run as long as number 23 is less than 18 and with each executed command number 23 will decrease by 2.
